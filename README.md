# The Project: NeuralNetwork
```
3rd year Epitech Project.
You need to create neural network that can take a chess board as input, and outputs the status of the game:
Either a player wins (checkmate), a player has the other playerâ€™s king checked, there is a draw (stalemate) or the game is still on.
